🧭 Step-by-Step Guide

➤ 1. Look at the Title  
📌 The title gives you the main idea of the paper and often hints at its core result or contribution.

➤ 2. Read the Abstract  
📝 The abstract is a short summary (usually less than a page) that tells you:  
• What the researchers studied  
• How they conducted the study (methods)  
• What they found (results)  
• Why those results matter

➤ 3. Check the Introduction  
📖  
• First Paragraph: Understand the background and why this topic is important  
• Last Paragraph: Find out the main research problem or question the paper is addressing

➤ 4. Skim the Results Section  
📊 Focus on bolded or highlighted headings to get the main findings  
You don’t need to read every table or figure unless it’s directly useful

➤ 5. Read the Final Paragraph of the Discussion or Conclusion  
💡 This part gives you:  
• The main takeaway  
• Why it’s important  
• What could be done in future research
